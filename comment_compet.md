So as far as we need to protect an egg we decided to use strings with rings and sof part.

Our main aim here is to use money profeciently and actually start making plans for each day if we really will meet every day.
As far as our deadline is around end of February we need to hurry with prices of each parts,prices of testing and so on to actually buy more for our personal project after comoetition.

We will make rocket from tubes as supposed, using engine and string system. I suppose it will not cost more than 2000 dollars

Once we are done with comp rocket, we can start doing our own (I suppose we can still add and improve competition rocket)

I'm excited with personal one, we can use simulations from jupyter or google collab, probably even make a real satelite this way (adding to 2000 dollars of course).

First I think we need to speak a lot about our ideas on that, but this whole stuff after the competition rocket is done.

Nothing much changed despite the fact that we are really closer everytime to a deadline, presentation is not ready because we don't yet have first flights, First flights will come only after the first kit will be bought, but it all depends on Mr Catalano and buying time. Despite that I think we must continue working on formulas, as for me, I didn't understand them all yet, today will work on it, probably add something. About the book about liquid hydrogen, I don't think we will make it this year for first flight,but for testing I think we have quite enough time, I will add chemical formulas and proportions and heat for each other type of engine we are thinking about, including carbon(I still really hope first flight will happen this year). I have thought on testing and building software if it's needed, but my biggest concern right now is time. I mean if some of you guys are reading it, I blame myself for not working as fast as I thought I would be, I just don't want to rush you guys because when I start working on a project I make everythin myself without other's opinions, if you have any thoughts or something please share. As for deadline I think it's perfect for first launch, and it's like deadline for the competition rocket. I guess we can already start and buy not only first kit but like parts for rocket itself. Also we don't need a lot of glue, I have an idea about that (if we don't use wood). I also found some really good competition, I guess it's too hard for us yet, but prise is ennourmous. Good night whoever reads my log and good night (if it's night).

I have an idea for our main project for rocket. We could first learn how to land it, then try to literary change trajectory according to cameras on certain object using machine learning in tenforlow. It's literary military killing machine. Cool concept, but it also could be used in smart flying, like drones, but faster and far more dangerous. Other people usually use for liquid engines something with alchohol or methanol, connected to carbon. If we will do the same it will be of course explosive, but also project similar to others. If we will choose hydrogen, it will be really costly, but basically it will be smaller version of actual rockets, on the other hand we could start a big research for the carbon based fuel engine. It will be just for research and show the interest from our project. For this we need properties of fuel, what state, temperature and reations it requires. I think we can work with those papers. Again, good night someone who's here, good bye. p.s. tomorrow we will ask Catalano about things we buy, new will come out tomorrow.
