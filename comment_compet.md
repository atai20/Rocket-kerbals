### Atai comments: January 2
So as far as we need to protect an egg we decided to use strings with rings and sof part.

Our main aim here is to use money profeciently and actually start making plans for each day if we really will meet every day.
As far as our deadline is around end of February we need to hurry with prices of each parts,prices of testing and so on to actually buy more for our personal project after comoetition.

We will make rocket from tubes as supposed, using engine and string system. I suppose it will not cost more than 2000 dollars

Once we are done with comp rocket, we can start doing our own (I suppose we can still add and improve competition rocket)

I'm excited with personal one, we can use simulations from jupyter or google collab, probably even make a real satelite this way (adding to 2000 dollars of course).

First I think we need to speak a lot about our ideas on that, but this whole stuff after the competition rocket is done.
