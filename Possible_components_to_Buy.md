# Inner tube(s)
* NOTE: while this is the closest body tube to our specifications of our shrocket, the measurments are still off
* [choice 1](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Building_Supplies/Body_Tube_Couplers/Standard_Couplers/AC-29A_Coupler?cPath=42_44_64&)
* If we cannot find our desired inner tube, I think it would be a good idea to make our own, they are relatively cheap and can be easily made
# Fins
* [choice 1](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Building-Supplies/Rocket-Fins/Clipped-Delta-Plywood-Fins-with-TTW-Tab)
* [choice 2](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Building-Supplies/Rocket-Fins/Clipped-Delta-Fins-with-Through-the-Wall-Tab)
* [choice 3](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Building-Supplies/Rocket-Fins/Clipped-Delta-Laser-cut-Fins-set-of-4)
* [choice 4](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Building_Supplies/Rocket_Fins/Rising_Star_Fins)
* [choice 5](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Building-Supplies/Rocket-Fins/Trapezoid-Laser-cut-Fins-set-of-4)
* [choice 6](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Building-Supplies/Rocket-Fins/Swept-Clipped-Delta-Fins-with-Through-the-Wall-Tab)
* fin's measurements precieceness is not that important. Its whole purpose is to move down the center of pressure so rocket is in correct direction, about every fin does that, so we are open to a lot of options here.
